This repository contains all the efforts I have made towards developing a simple tool to model the lifecycle of infrastructure projects. 

# Establishing a Site
## Sites that require accommodation for workers
For sites that are too far away from a suitable town where workers can be accommodated, provisions must be supplied on site.
These include:
1. Portable toilets.
2. Diesel Generators for Electricity.
3. Site Offices.
4. Site Accommodation and Amentities.
5. Storage Facilites.
6. Water Storage.

The size of the site is a function of the maximum number of people required on site at any particular time. 

# Earth Works
## Excavating fill material and transporting to site
The Excavator removes material from the ground and loads it onto The Dump Truck. 
The Dump Truck drives the material to The Construction Site.
The Dump Truck unloads the material to a Stockpile or into Position.
The Dump Truck returns to the Removal Site.

The number of excavators, dump trucks is determined by the volume of material required, the loading time, and the round trip time for the dump truck.

## Embankment Construction
When the fill material is deposited it then needs to be shaped and compacted in place. 
If the embankments are to support vehicles a road will also need to be constructed. 

## Laying Pipelines
The Goods Truck transports the pipes to site, where they are stockpiled.
An Excavator digs a trench for the pipe. 
A Crane lowers the pipe into the trench where it is positioned. 

# Perturbation Analysis
This may or may not be necessary, but as the complexity of the system increases, all of the parameters will need to be tested to see their effect on the overall performance of the system. This could be achieved by adjusting parameters in a sensitivity analysis. If the effect of a change increased the performance of the whole system, the effect could be studied until it's effect. Running sensitivity analysises on system models would be useful for optimisation.
